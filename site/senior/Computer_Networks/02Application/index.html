<h1 id="02-application">02 - Application</h1>
<h2 id="network-applications">Network applications</h2>
<ul>
<li>Classic text-based applications that became popular in the 1970s and 1980s: <ul>
<li>text email. remote access to computers, file transfers, and newsgroups. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Killer application of the mid-1990s:<ul>
<li>The World Wide Web, encompassing Web surfing, search, and electronic commerce. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Instant messaging and P2P file sharing, the two killer applications introduced at the end of the millennium. </li>
<li>Since 2000, voice-over-IP (VoIP), YouTube, Netflix, World of Warcraft, Facebook, and Twitter. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Goal</strong> write program that: 
- run on (different) end systems
- communicate over network
- e.g., web server software communicates with browser software</p>
<p>No need (or desire) to write software for network-core devices: 
- network-core devices do not (and SHOULD not) run user applications!
- applications on end systems allows for rapid app development, propagation, innovation
- this is changing somewhat, which could impede the development of new protocols. </p>
<h2 id="server">Server</h2>
<ul>
<li>Always-on host, called the server, which services requests from many other hosts, called clients. </li>
<li>permanent address<ul>
<li>IP address</li>
<li>Overlay/hash address of some kind in the case of IP-anonymizing networks </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Web server services requests from browsers running on client hosts. </li>
<li>When a Web server receives a request for an object from a client hosts, it responds by sending the requested object to the client host. </li>
<li>Now in data centers for scaling </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="client">Client</h2>
<ul>
<li>Communicate with server</li>
<li>Maybe be intermittently connected</li>
<li>May have dynamic IP addresses (or dynamically changing overlay addresses)</li>
<li>Do not usually communicate directly with each other (unless hybrid client-server/p2p with p2p). </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="p2p-architecture">P2P architecture</h2>
<ul>
<li>Minimal (or no) reliance on dedicated servers in data centers. </li>
<li>Direct communication between pairs of intermittently connected hosts, called peers. </li>
<li>The peers are not owned by the service provider, but are instead desktops and laptops controlled by users, with most of the peers residing in homes, universities, and offices.</li>
<li>Peers request service from other peers, provide service in return to other peers <ul>
<li>Self-scalability: each peer adds service capacity to the system by distributing files to other peers. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cost effective, since they normally don't require significant server infrastructure and server bandwidth (in contrast with clients-server designs with data centers)</li>
<li>Peers often exchange IP addresses (or overlay address, e.g., onion, garlic routing and crypto addresses).<ul>
<li>Complex management, implementation, debugging? </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="processes">Processes</h2>
<ul>
<li>It's not actually programs, but <strong>processes</strong> that communicate with each other. </li>
<li>A process is assigned by OS to a program that is running within an end system. </li>
<li>WHen processes are running on the same end system, they can communicate with each other with inter-process communication (IPC)</li>
<li>Processes on two different end systems communicate with each other by exchanging <strong>messages</strong> across the computer network. </li>
<li>A sending process creates and sends messages into the network </li>
<li>A receiving process receives these messages and possibly responds by sending messages back. </li>
<li>Processes that initiates that communication (that is, initially contacts the other process at the beginning of the session) is nominally, if not substantially, labeled as the <strong>client</strong>. </li>
<li>The process that waits to be contacted to begin the session is nominally the <strong>server</strong> </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="sockets">Sockets</h2>
<ul>
<li>Any message sent from one process to another must go through the underlying network. </li>
<li>A process sends messages into, and receives messages from, the network through an OS-defined software interface called a <strong>socket</strong>.</li>
<li>A socket is the interface between the application layer and the within a host OS. </li>
<li>It is also referred to as the Application Programming Interface (API) between the application and the network, since the socket is the programming interface with which network applications are built. </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="addresses">Addresses</h2>
<ul>
<li>To receive messages, process must have identifier </li>
</ul>
<p>Q: Does the IP address of a host, on which a process runs, suffice for identifying the process? </p>
<p>A: No, many processes can be running on one host </p>
<ul>
<li>In order for a process running on one host to send packets to a process running on another host, the receiving process needs to have an <strong>address</strong> with: <ul>
<li>address of the host OS itself (IP)</li>
<li>Identifier that specifies the specific receiving process in the destination host OS </li>
<li>Popular applications have been assigned specific port numbers, e.g., <ul>
<li>A Web server (using the HTTP protocol) is usually identified by port number 80. </li>
<li>A mail server process (using the SMTP protocol) is usually identified by port number 25.</li>
<li>An SSH server is usually identified on port number 22. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, to send HTTP message to gaia.cs.umass.edu web server: </p>
<p>IP address: 128.119.245.12
  port number: 80</p>
<p>Hosts are often identified by IP address
- <strong>IP address</strong> is a 32-bit quantity uniquely identifying the host, in ipv4.
    - Addresses are 128 bit for ipv6. 
    - We ran out of ipv4 addresses...
- The sending process must also identify the receiving process (more specifically, the receiving socket) running in the host. 
    - This is information is needed because in general a host could be running many network applications. 
    - A destination port number serves this purpose. </p>
<h2 id="preview-of-transport-services">Preview of transport services</h2>
<p><strong>Data integrity</strong> 
- Some apps (e.g., file transfer, web transactions) require 100% reliable data transfer 
- Other apps (e.g., audio) can tolerate some loss</p>
<p><strong>timing</strong> 
- Some apps (e.g., Internet telephony, interactive games) require low delay to be "effective" 
- Some apps (e.g., file download) tolerate delay </p>
<p><strong>throughput</strong> 
- Some apps (e.g., multimedia) require minimum amount of throughput to be "effective"
- Other apps ("elastic apps") make use of whatever throughput they get </p>
<p><strong>security</strong> 
- Encryption, data integrity, ...</p>
<h2 id="multiple-types-of-service">Multiple types of service:</h2>
<p><strong>Application usually choose between TCP and UDP</strong> 
- TCP and UDP are transport layer 
- Employed by most application layer programs
- Other Transport layer, or pseudo-transport layer protocols exist. 
    - SCTP (stream control transmission protocol), SSU (I2P app), DCCP, RUDP, UDP-lite, etc. 
- An application designer could design their own transport layer protocol, since Transport layer and up runs on end hosts, as opposed to network infrastructure. 
    - Could build into the core/kernel of end operating systems and languages as new socket type. 
    - Could also just begin the features into the application layer, rather than actually get a transport protocol built into the kernel of an OS. 
    - UDP lets you build new things!</p>
<h2 id="tcp">TCP</h2>
<p><strong>Connection-oriented service</strong> 
- TCP has the client and server exchange transport-layer control information with each other, before the application-level messages begin to flow. 
- This so-called handshaking procedure alerts the client and server, allow them to prepare for an onslaught of packets. 
- After the handshaking phase, a TCP connection is said to exist between the sockets of the two processes. 
- The connection is a full-duplex connection, in that the two processes can both send messages to each other over the connection at the same time, bi-directionally
- When the application finishes sending messages, it must tear down the connection. </p>
<p><strong>TCP has a reliable data transfer service</strong> 
- The communicating process can rely on TCP to deliver all data sent without error and in the proper order. </p>
<p><strong>TCP also includes a congestion-control mechanism</strong> 
- The TCP congestion-control mechanism throttles a sending process (client or server) when the network is congested between sender and receiver. </p>
<p>Summary</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>reliable transport:</strong> between sending and receiving process</li>
<li><strong>flow control:</strong> sender won't overwhelm receiver </li>
<li><strong>congestion control:</strong> throttle sender when network overloaded</li>
<li><strong>does ot provide:</strong> timing, minimum throughput guarantee, security </li>
<li><strong>connection-oriented:</strong> setup required between client and server process </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="udp">UDP</h2>
<ul>
<li>UDP is a no-fills, lightweight, transport protocol, providing minimal services. </li>
<li>UDP is a connectionless, so there is no handshaking before the two processes start to communicate. </li>
<li>UDP provides an unreliable data transfer service</li>
<li>When a process sends a message will ever reach the receiving process. </li>
<li>Messages that do arrive at the receiving process may arrive out of order. </li>
<li>UDP does not include a congestion-control mechanism, so the sending side of UDP can attempt to pump data into the layer below (the network layer) at any rate ot pleases</li>
</ul>
<p>UDP service: 
- Unreliable data transfer between sending and receiving process
- Does not provide: reliability, flow control, congestion control, timing, throughput guarantee, security, or connection setup. </p>
<h2 id="encryption">Encryption</h2>
<p>Neither base TCP nor UDP provide any encryption!</p>
<p>An Enhancement for TCP provides: </p>
<ol>
<li>encryption,</li>
<li>data integrity, and </li>
<li>end-point authentication. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The great thing about a TLS joke, is that you can tell if it's not the original...</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This security enhancement used to be called <strong>Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)</strong></li>
<li>Transport layer security <strong>(TLS)</strong> is just a newer version of SSL. <ul>
<li>SSL was the name of now-defunct versions of what is now modern TLS. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>TLS is not a third Internet transport protocol, on the same level as TCP and UDP, but an enhancement of TCP, at the application layer. </li>
<li>Applications needs to include TLS code (existing libraries) in both the client and server sides of the application. </li>
<li>TLS has its own socket API that is similar to the traditional TCP socket API. </li>
<li>Sending process passes cleartext data to the SSL socket.</li>
<li>TLS in the sending host then encrypts the data and passes the encrypted data to the TCP socket. </li>
<li>Encrypted data travels over the Internet to the TCP socket in the receiving process. </li>
<li>Receiving socket passes the encrypted data to SSL, which decrypts the data.</li>
<li>TLS passes the cleartext data through its SSL socket to the receiving process. </li>
<li>TLS socket API is like that of a TCP socket (just important and use).</li>
</ul>
<p>Tunneling:
    Inner-most -&gt;  Outer-more... &gt; Outer-most 
    Application -&gt; TLS -&gt; TCP -&gt; MAC -&gt; Ethernet -&gt; Physical </p>
<h2 id="application-layer-protocols">Application-layer protocols</h2>
<p>An <strong>application-layer protocol</strong> defines how an application's processes, running on different end systems, pass messages to each other, for exmaple:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>type of messages</strong> exchanged, for example, request messages and response messages<ul>
<li>E.g., request, response </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The <strong>syntax</strong> of the various message types, such as the fields in the message and how the fields are delineated</li>
<li>The <strong>semantics</strong> of the fields<ul>
<li>Meaning of the information in the fields</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Rules</strong> for determining when and how a process sends messages and responds to messages, and change state. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Open protocols:</strong>
defined in RFCs
allows for interoperability 
e.g., HTTP, SMTP
<strong>Proprietary protocols:</strong>
e.g., Skype (sued to be open, fun story)</p>
